**Do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email us at: [s.werner@sebastian-software.de](mailto:s.werner@sebastian-software.de)

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

## Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days

- Once fixed, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Scope

This security policy applies to the `eslint-plugin-lingui-typescript` npm package and its source code repository.

Since this is an ESLint plugin that only runs during development/linting (not in production), the attack surface is limited. However, we still take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Best Practices for Users

- Keep your dependencies up to date
- Use `npm audit` regularly
- Pin dependencies in production environments
