# Git Conventions

## Commit Style

### Conventional Commits

Use the conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, no code change
- `refactor`: Code change without feature/fix
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `build`: Build system, dependencies
- `ci`: CI configuration
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Commit Size

- **Small, atomic commits**: One logical change per commit
- **Buildable**: Each commit should leave the project in a working state
- **Reviewable**: Easy to understand in isolation

### Commit Messages

- **Subject line**: Imperative mood, max 72 chars, no period
- **Body**: Only when subject isn't self-explanatory
- **Body style**: Bullet points or short lines, no prose
- **Focus**: Technical details, rationale for non-obvious decisions

### Examples

```
feat(rules): add no-complex-expressions rule
```

```
build: configure typescript strict mode

- noUncheckedIndexedAccess for array safety
- exactOptionalPropertyTypes distinguishes undefined vs missing
- verbatimModuleSyntax enforces explicit type imports
```

```
fix(parser): handle missing type info gracefully

- parserServices.program may be undefined without tsconfig
- skip type-aware checks instead of throwing
```

### What NOT to Include in Body

- Obvious information repeating the subject
- Prose or filler text
- Implementation details visible in the diff
- Generic statements like "Updated code"
